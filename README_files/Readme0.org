* A parametric sweep workflow for a welding case
  This workflow implements  a parameter sweep on a parametric model of a 
  thermomechanical simulation of a bead-on-plate welding process.
  
  In this workflow:
   - The geometry and mesh is generated using [[http://www.salome-platform.org/][Salome platform]] (version 8.2.0)
   - The thrmomechanical simulation of the welding process is performed with the open source [[http://www.dhondt.de/][CalculiX FEA solver]] (version 2.12)
   - Post-processing is performed using [[https://www.paraview.org/][ParaView]] and a [[https://github.com/parallelworks/MetricExtraction][python library]] developed by Parallel Works for automated generation of output images and metrics extraction.

  The workflow is implemented with [[http://swift-lang.org/main/][Swift]].

** Required software
   - The required software for executing this workflow are dockerized (see [[https://hub.docker.com/u/parallelworks/?page=1]] and  https://github.com/parallelworks/Dockerfiles).
   - Executing the workflow requires installing Swift (see [[http://swift-lang.org/tutorials/localhost/tutorial.html#_swift_installation]]), and docker ([[https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/]])
** Instructions for running the workflow
   To run the workflow, run the following command from the main directory:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   swift main.swift -sweepParamFile=inputs/sweepParams_fast.run  
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   The =sweepParamFile= specifies the file with the parameter values for running the workflow. More examples are in the directory =inputs/=
